**Paisa** is a Personal finance manager. It builds on
top of the [ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org/) double entry accounting tool. Checkout
[documentation](https://paisa.fyi) to get started.

# Demo

A demo of the Web UI can be found at [https://demo.paisa.fyi](https://demo.paisa.fyi)

## Status

I use it to track my personal finance. It's more like alpha product
now, usable, but I might update things based on the feedback I
receive. Feel free to open an issue if you found a bug or start a
discussion if you have a feature request. If you have any question,
you can ask on [Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#paisa:matrix.org).

## Contribution Policy

Paisa is open source, but I do not plan to accept any pull request for
now. If you have a feature request, start a [discussion](https://github.com/ananthakumaran/paisa/discussions), or if you
found a bug, create a new [issue](https://github.com/ananthakumaran/paisa/issues). Since this a UI project, I would
prefer to have full control over how things are done. I might relax
this restriction later.
