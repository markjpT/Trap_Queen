# CHANGELOG

### 0.5.5 (2023-10-07)

* Support account icon customization
* Add beancount ledger client support

### 0.5.4 (2023-10-07)

* Add calendar view to recurring page
* Support [recurring period](https://paisa.fyi/reference/recurring/#period) configuration
* Support European number format
* Bug fixes

### 0.5.3 (2023-09-30)

* Add Docker Image
* Add Linux Application (deb package)
* Move import templates to configuration file
* Bug fixes

## Breaking Changes :rotating_light:

User's custom import templates used to be stored in Database, which is
a bad idea in hindsight. It's being moved to the configuration
file. With this change, all the data in paisa.db would be transient
and can be deleted and re created from the journal and configuration
files without any data loss.

If you have custom template, take a backup before you upgrade and add
it again via new version. If you have already upgraded, you can still
get the data directly from the db file using the following query
`sqlite3 paisa.db "select * from templates";`

### 0.5.2 (2023-09-22)

* Add Desktop app
* Support password protected PDF on import page
* Bug fixes

## Breaking Changes :rotating_light:

* The structure of price code configuration has been updated to make
  it easier to add more price provider in the future. In addition to
  the code, the provider name also has to be added. Refer the
  [config](https://paisa.fyi/reference/config/) documentation for more details
