# Capital Gains

Mutual Funds are considered as capital asset and capital gains tax
will be charged on any gains. Capital Gains page shows the financial
year wise capital gains tax based on the withdrawal transaction. The
sum total, account wise breakdown, and per buy/sell match information
are available.

Only commodities with `tax_category` are considered. Please check [Tax
Harvesting](tax-harvesting.md) page for configuration details.

### Gain

The difference between the purchase and sell price.

### Taxable Gain

The gain after applying Indexation or Grandfathering provision.


Based on the duration between the purchase and sell date, an asset
might be classified as Short Term or Long Term.

### Short Term Tax

This would be a percentage of the Taxable Gain. The percentage varies
based on the asset class.

### Long Term Tax

This would be a percentage of the Taxable Gain. The percentage varies
based on the asset class.

### Taxable at Slab Rate

There are cases where the gain would be added to taxable income and
charged **Slab** rate. Since the tax rate would depend on the person,
the whole taxable amount is shown instead of the tax. You can multiply
this with your slab rate to get the tax amount.
